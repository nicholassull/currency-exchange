## Description

_This webpage receives an amount of USD from the user along with a currency the user would like to convert that amount into. After the user submits these, the webpage will display the exchanged amount to the right of the input fields. Finally, if the API call results in an error, the user will be notified and given the relevant error information. This webpage was built to showcase my understanding of API calls, session storage, and asynchronous JavaScript._
